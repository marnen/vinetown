Matt's Thoughts:
Chat room accomplished through comments instead. Maybe reddit still news board that focuses on wine.
Support for user selected colors and backgrounds for personal page is a bad idea. Facebook vs. Myspace, 'nuf said.
Clubs isn't a bad idea, though perhaps either instead or in addition too we want to through up pages for different regions and types of wine.
Carol wants this to be media rich, how do I accomplish this (hint, talk to kb)
