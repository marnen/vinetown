on users:
search for users - done
add martial status, disambiguate from regular status
friend interface => better way to add friends, control who sees your profile etc.
ajax status bar stuff
ajax comments
use fucking jquery

build out:
structure for where posts go
	this will require finding some alternative to h() in order to properly parse certain markup elements (line breaks, headers, links, etc, while escaping <script> etc for security reasons. This could be homebrewed which would be fun, but open libraries should exist.)
layer home/community/neighborhood
	should just contain posts


later:
ajax comments

New (as of 3.25.09)
Right now:
comments => Modalize them maybe? ajax for sure
Wine Diary (just a front end to a post) - add bool to post for this, create separate list
Integrates status updates in with posts for purposes of posting.

Ajax - comments, status. Use jquery
Pull in posts posted to groups user in member of.

Down the road
Full security audit and db optimizations
