on users:
search for users - done
add martial status, disambiguate from regular status
friend interface => better way to add friends, control who sees your profile etc.
ajax status bar stuff


build out:
structure for where posts go
	this will require finding some alternative to h() in order to properly parse certain markup elements (line breaks, headers, links, etc, while escaping <script> etc for security reasons. This could be homebrewed which would be fun, but open libraries should exist.)
layer home/community/neighborhood
	should just contain posts


later:
ajax comments
